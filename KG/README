The KG is in RDF/OWL. The files are as follows: 

UL_KB_V3_PUB.ttl -->  the graph file is self-contained. It can be installed in any triplestore and queried with SPARQL
The two previous versions, V2 and V1 are added here for completeness

KBAccess_RDF -->  is the Jupyter notebook with examples of the JSON API and the underlying SPARQL queries.  The API calls use the file 

ulkb_access.py --> the implementation of the JSON API. 


Any issues or questions about the graph, contact rosariou@us.ibm.com
